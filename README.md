#overview_of_project

Twitter sentiment analysis is crucial in understanding public opinion, brand perception, and social trends. This project analysed the sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of tweets related to a specific topic using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The project utilized a dataset of tweets collected through Kaggles (https://www.kaggle.com/), encompassing a diverse range of user-generated content. 

#Preprocessing steps were applied to clean the text data, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming. Sentiment analysis was performed using a supervised machine learning approach, specifically employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on a labelled dataset. The evaluation of the sentiment analysis model achieved an accuracy of 85%, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting sentiment. 
The analysis of the collected data revealed interesting trends and insights into public sentiment regarding the chosen topic. 

#Positive sentiment was predominant, indicating overall satisfaction and support, while #negative sentiment highlighted specific concerns and criticisms. 

The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of public sentiment on Twitter and have implications for organizations and researchers seeking to monitor and respond to online sentiment.
